# Security Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in Agent Flow Builder X and provides guidance for secure deployment and operation.

## Security Fixes Implemented

### ✅ Critical Vulnerabilities Fixed

1. **Removed Hardcoded API Keys** (OWASP A02: Cryptographic Failures)
   - All hardcoded API keys removed from source code
   - Environment variable usage enforced
   - Secure .env.example template created

2. **Secured Code Execution Endpoints** (OWASP A03: Injection)
   - Added authentication middleware to `/api/execute`
   - Implemented rate limiting (50 requests/15 minutes)
   - Added input validation and sanitization
   - Set execution timeouts (60 seconds)

3. **Fixed Path Traversal Vulnerabilities** (OWASP A01: Broken Access Control)
   - Implemented path validation in `create-agent.ts`
   - Added input sanitization for file paths
   - Restricted file operations to designated directories

### ✅ High Priority Security Enhancements

4. **Fixed CORS Configuration** (OWASP A05: Security Misconfiguration)
   - Removed wildcard CORS (`*`) policies
   - Eliminated production bypass allowing all origins
   - Implemented strict origin whitelist

5. **Added Security Headers** (OWASP A05: Security Misconfiguration)
   - Implemented helmet.js middleware
   - Added CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options headers
   - Configured secure content policies

6. **Removed Credential Logging** (OWASP A09: Security Logging Failures)
   - Eliminated API key logging in langfuseService.ts
   - Implemented secure logging patterns

### ✅ Medium Priority Improvements

7. **Reduced Request Body Limits**
   - Lowered from 50MB to 10MB
   - Added request validation middleware
   - Limited URL parameters to 100

8. **Enhanced Environment Security**
   - Created comprehensive .env template
   - Added security configuration checklist
   - Documented secure deployment practices

## Security Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization

- **API Key Authentication**: Optional but recommended for production
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse with configurable limits
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs sanitized and validated
- **Origin Validation**: CORS restricted to approved domains

### Network Security

- **CORS Policy**: Strict origin whitelist, no wildcards
- **Security Headers**: Full helmet.js protection
- **Content Security Policy**: Prevents XSS attacks
- **HSTS**: Forces HTTPS connections

### Data Protection

- **Environment Variables**: All secrets in environment, never hardcoded
- **Secure Logging**: No credentials or sensitive data logged
- **Path Validation**: Prevents directory traversal attacks
- **Input Sanitization**: Removes dangerous patterns

## Production Deployment Guide

### Pre-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] All API keys replaced with production values
- [ ] `.env` file configured and secured
- [ ] `API_SECRET_KEY` set for endpoint security
- [ ] CORS origins updated for production domains
- [ ] Security headers verified via helmet.js
- [ ] Rate limiting configured appropriately
- [ ] File upload limits set to reasonable values

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Required Production Variables
API_SECRET_KEY=your_secure_random_string_here
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_production_google_key
E2B_API_KEY=your_production_e2b_key

# Optional but Recommended
VITE_OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_key
SMITHERY_API_KEY=your_smithery_key
```

### Security Configuration

1. **Set Strong API Secret**:
   ```bash
   # Generate a strong API secret
   openssl rand -base64 32
   ```

2. **Configure CORS Origins**:
   - Update allowed origins in `server/index.js`
   - Update Vercel configuration in `vercel.json`

3. **Monitor Rate Limits**:
   - Review rate limiting settings
   - Monitor for abuse patterns
   - Adjust limits based on usage

## Security Monitoring

### Recommended Monitoring

- **Failed Authentication Attempts**: Monitor 401/403 responses
- **Rate Limit Violations**: Track 429 responses
- **CORS Violations**: Monitor blocked cross-origin requests
- **Large Request Bodies**: Alert on maximum size requests
- **Unusual API Usage**: Monitor for suspicious patterns

### Logging Best Practices

- Never log API keys, tokens, or passwords
- Log security events (auth failures, rate limits)
- Use structured logging for security analysis
- Implement log rotation and retention policies

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Procedures

1. **API Key Compromise**:
   - Immediately revoke compromised keys
   - Generate new keys
   - Update environment variables
   - Review access logs

2. **Unauthorized Access**:
   - Enable additional authentication
   - Review and tighten CORS policies
   - Increase rate limiting
   - Audit all recent activities

3. **Code Injection Attempts**:
   - Review input validation
   - Check sandbox security
   - Update content security policies
   - Monitor execution logs

## Regular Security Maintenance

### Monthly Tasks

- [ ] Review and rotate API keys
- [ ] Update dependencies for security patches
- [ ] Review access logs for anomalies
- [ ] Test backup and recovery procedures

### Quarterly Tasks

- [ ] Security audit of code and configuration
- [ ] Penetration testing of endpoints
- [ ] Review and update security policies
- [ ] Update incident response procedures
